Overview
~~~~~~~~

ReAgent is an open source end-to-end platform for applied reinforcement learning (RL) developed and used at Facebook.
ReAgent is built in Python and uses PyTorch for modeling and training and TorchScript for model serving. The platform contains
workflows to train popular deep RL algorithms and includes data preprocessing, feature transformation, distributed training,
counterfactual policy evaluation, and optimized serving. For more detailed information about ReAgent see the white
paper here: `Platform <https://research.fb.com/publications/horizon-facebooks-open-source-applied-reinforcement-learning-platform/>`_.

The source code is available here: `Source code <https://github.com/facebookresearch/Horizon>`_.

The platform was once named "Horizon" but we have adopted the name "ReAgent" recently to emphasize its broader scope in decision making and reasoning.
