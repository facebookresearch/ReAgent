### Overview
ReAgent is an open source end-to-end platform for applied reinforcement learning (RL) developed and used at Facebook. ReAgent is built in Python and uses PyTorch for modeling and training and TorchScript for model serving. The platform contains workflows to train popular deep RL algorithms and includes data preprocessing, feature transformation, distributed training, counterfactual policy evaluation, and optimized serving. For more detailed information about ReAgent see the release post [here](https://research.fb.com/publications/horizon-facebooks-open-source-applied-reinforcement-learning-platform/) and white paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00260).

The platform was once named "Horizon" but we have adopted the name "ReAgent" recently to emphasize its broader scope in decision making and reasoning.

### Installation
ReAgent can be installed via. Docker or manually. Detailed instructions on how to install ReAgent can be found [here](docs/installation.rst).

### Tutorial
ReAgent is designed for large-scale, distributed recommendation/optimization tasks where we don’t have access to a simulator.
In this environment, it is typically better to train offline on batches of data, and release new policies slowly over time.
Because the policy updates slowly and in batches, we use off-policy algorithms. To test a new policy without deploying it,
we rely on counter-factual policy evaluation (CPE), a set of techniques for estimating a policy based on the actions of another policy.

We also have a set of tools to facilitate applying RL in real-world applications:
- Domain Analysis Tool, which analyzes state/action feature importance and identifies whether the problem is a suitable for applying batch RL
- Behavior Cloning, which clones from the logging policy to bootstrap the learning policy safely

Detailed instructions on how to use ReAgent can be found [here](docs/usage.rst).
