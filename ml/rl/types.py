EXPERIMENTAL

These generic types define common interface between modules. Above all, these
facilitates model exporting through ONNX. ONNX doesn't trace dictionary so we
use NamedTuple to act in place of dictionaries. NamedTuple is also more compact
than dictionary; so, this should be good overall.
