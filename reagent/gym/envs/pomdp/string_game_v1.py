"""
A game with a stochastic length of the MDP but no longer than 3.

An agent can choose one character to reveal (either "A" or "B") as the action,
and the next state is exactly the action just taken (i.e., the transition
function only depends on the action). Each episode is limited to 3 steps.

There is some probability to terminate at any step (but the agent must terminate if
making 3 steps)
If the current state is "A", the agent has 0.5 probability to make to the next step.
If the current state is "B", the agent has 0.9 probability to make to the next step.
The reward is given at the terminal state, based on the accumulated observation (a string).

If the agent observes "AAA" (survive the first 2 steps and terminate at the last step
 no matter what action taken), it receives +5 reward.
If the agent observes "BA" (survive the first step and terminate at the second step),
it receives +4 reward.
For all other scenarios, the agent receives 0 reward.

If we plan for 3 steps ahead from the beginning, "A" is the better action to take first.
If we plan with consideration of termination probabilities, "B" is better. Because:
The expected Q-value of "A" = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * max(0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * max(5, 0), 0) = 1.25
The expected Q-value of "B" = 0.1 * 0 + 0.9 * max(0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * max(0, 0), 0) = 1.8
